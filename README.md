Work in progress: 

After the most recent update there is metronome functionality. 
However, the .exe file cannot be pushed to git.  If you want to run the program with it's metronome contact Thomas or Justin and we will send you the source code so you can compile it and create your own exe.  

Then you will need to move the exe into the QT project's working directory.  Once it is there along with the wav files necessary for the ticking of the metronome you will need to specify the exact file path for your machine.  This needs to be updated at the bottom of the main window.cpp

Contact us if you have any trouble.
